% c2no  Perform a Constant-size, Compact and Non-Overlapping clustering of a Point Cloud.
%
%       This function receives a Point Cloud, and outputs a set of clusters
%       with the same number of points, specified by ppc. If the total
%       number of points is not multiple of ppc, the user can specify if
%       only 1 cluster should be incomplete with the remaining points, or
%       if all points should be equally distributed. These incomplete
%       clusters can be padded by repeating points.
%       The resulting clusters are compact and do not overlap each other.
%       A detailed description of the algorithm is available at:
%
%   usage:  
%       c2no(infile, outpcname, outfolder, ppc)
%       c2no(infile, outpcname, outfolder, ppc, cnn)

%
%   input arguments:
%       infile - Input filename of the point cloud to cluster (PLY or PCD)
%       outpcname - Output clusters basename
%       outfolder - Output clusters directory path
%       ppc - Target number of points per cluster
%
%   optional input arguments:
%       cnn - Number of nearest neighboring clusters eligible for transfers
%           and refinement (Default: 10)
%       nb - Number of block divisions on each direction for Cluster
%           Centroid Initialization step, which divides the point cloud
%           into nb*nb*nb blocks (Default: 8)
%       mic - Selects the approach for dealing with target cluster sizes
%           when the total number of points in the point cloud is not
%           multiple of ppc; TRUE uses the Minimally Incomplete Clusters
%           case, where points are equally distributed through all
%           clusters; FALSE uses the Single Incomplete Cluster case, where
%           all but one cluster will have ppc points, and one cluster will
%           have the remaining points (Default: TRUE)
%       padding - Selects if padding is applied to incomplete clusters,
%           when the total number of points in the point cloud is not
%           multiple of ppc (Default: TRUE)
%       debug - This option allows tracking the progress of the algorithm
%           in the different stages, computing cluster dispersion metrics
%           at each iteration, and saving the clusters at the end of each
%           phase (Default: FALSE)
%
%   output arguments:
%       progress - 2D Matrix with the number of points in each cluster for
%           each iteration of the Iterative Clustering Phase
%       clust_disp - 3D Matrix with the cluster dispersion (measured as the
%           variance of cluster coordinates) for each of the 3 dimensions,
%           for each cluster, at each iteration of the Iterative Clustering
%           Phase (only if debug=TRUE)
%       clust_bb - 3D Matrix with the cluster dispersion (measured as the
%           range of cluster coordinates) for each of the 3 dimensions,
%           for each cluster, at each iteration of the Iterative Clustering
%           Phase (only if debug=TRUE)
%       sum_dists - 1D Matrix with the sum of distances between points and
%           respective centroids, averaged for all clusters, taken at each
%           iteration of the Clustering Refinement Phase (only if
%           debug=TRUE)
%       iter_adj_rest - Indicates at which iteration of the Iterative
%           Clustering Phase the adjacency restriction was lifted, or the
%           value 0 if it was not (only if debug=TRUE)
